        <h5>A THOUGHT OR TWO</h5>
        <p>
            I'll give you a sign that's obvious<br>
            One of the most supernatural acts<br>
            is that God through his Word has actually<br>
            revealed everything pertaining to life in Godliness<br>
            There's this idea that an individual<br>
            Is somehow more spiritual<br>
            If he sees these signs and symbols<br>
            And takes what's normally invisible<br>
            And makes it simple<br>
            But I say the mark of a mature man<br>
            Is the one who reads God's Word and understands<br>
            And allows that to govern his decisions and his perspective plans<br><br>
            
            Scratch your temple<br>
            So deep it's simple<br>
            Silly us, ignore the plain<br>
            We prefer a riddle<br>
            Dying to see a miracle<br>
            While holding God's diary<br>
            Looking for signs<br><br>
