            <b>1 John 4:15-19</b>
            <br>
            <b>15</b> Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
            <br>
            <b>16</b> And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.
            <br>
            <b>17</b> Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment:  because as he is, so are we in this world.
            <br>
            <b>18</b> There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
            <br>
            <b>19</b> We love him, because he first loved us.
